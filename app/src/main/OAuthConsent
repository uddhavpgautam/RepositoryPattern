OAuth2
OAuth 2.0, which stands for “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or
application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.

OAuth2.0 Roles
    * Resource Owner: The user or system that owns the protected resources and can grant access to them.
    * Client: The client is the system that requires access to the protected resources.
                To access resources, the Client must hold the appropriate Access Token.
    * Authorization Server: This server receives requests from the Client for Access Tokens and issues
                them upon successful authentication and consent by the Resource Owner. The authorization server
                exposes two endpoints: the Authorization endpoint, which handles the interactive authentication and
                consent of the user, and the Token endpoint, which is involved in a machine to machine interaction.
    * Resource Server: A server that protects the user’s resources and receives access requests from the Client.
                It accepts and validates an Access Token from the Client and returns the appropriate resources to it.

Apps _______ OAuth _______ Authorized domains
n order to securely access an online service, users need to authenticate to the service—they need
to provide proof of their identity. For an application that accesses a third-party service,
the security problem is even more complicated. Not only does the user need to be authenticated
to access the service, but the application also needs to be authorized to act on the user's behalf.
E.g., I log in TDA Mobile app using my biometric or username/password. Now, Trading quote, let's
assume, are coming from separate third-party service called DIGS service, which has separate domain.
Those domains should be authorized domains.

How OAuth helps to identify apps know these authorized domains?
The industry standard way to deal with authentication to third-party services is the OAuth2 protocol.
OAuth2 provides a single value, called an auth token, that represents both the user's identity and
the application's authorization to act on the user's behalf.
