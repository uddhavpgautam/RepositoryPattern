    <issue category="Correctness"
        explanation="Using the comment `// STOPSHIP` can be used to flag code that is incomplete but checked in. This comment marker can be used to indicate that the code should not be shipped until the issue is addressed, and lint will look for these. In Gradle projects, this is only checked for non-debug (release) builds.&#xA;&#xA;In Kotlin, the `TODO()` method is also treated as a stop ship marker; you can use it to make incomplete code compile, but it will throw an exception at runtime and therefore should be fixed before shipping releases."
